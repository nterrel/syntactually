# --- Variables ---
# No spaces around '='. Variables are untyped strings by default.

# Use braces when concatenating with text to avoid ambiguity:
file="data"

# With 'set -u', referencing an unset var is an error, so use defaults:

# --- Quoting rules (VERY IMPORTANT) ---
# "double quotes" expand variables, command substitutions, and backslashes like \n in $'...' only.
# 'single quotes' are literal (no expansion).
# unquoted variables undergo word splitting + glob expansion (often a bug).
