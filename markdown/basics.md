# Title of this note

Some formatting I might use

## This is a section

This section has some text:
- *Some* of that text **might** be formatted
- Some additional text might be formatted, too.

## This is a second section

> It is based on an idea I'm presenting here

I will talk about the subject in two ways:
1. One
2. Two

I might reference some [code](https://github.com/nterrel)...
`some command`

Or, I might even leave a comment about how to insert an image.

### This section has subheaders

In this subsection I'll put some code blocks.
```
{  
  "firstName": "John",  
  "lastName": "Smith",  
  "age": 25,
  "option+8": •,
}  
```

They can use different languages. Say I have a script, `code.py`:
```python
import timeit

setup_code = """
def function_to_time(int: x):
    return x*x
"""

statement_code = "function_to_time(10)"

execution_time = timeit.timeit(stmt=statement_code, setup=setup_code, number=100)
print(f"Average time to execute over 100 runs: {execution_time / 10000:.6f} seconds per run")
```

Which I want to run in a bash shell:

```bash
python code.py
```


### See, plural.

~~Maybe I'd say something incorrect.~~
I can also insert footnotes to cite or add supporting information in a hidden way.[^1]

- [x] Write cheat sheet for markdown syntax
- [ ] Correct any mistakes
- [ ] ==Finalize the list of commands==

option+8 lets you write a •

I didn't look at it until after a few sources, but this was a very good one: 
[https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet]

This is the end.
