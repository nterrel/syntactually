Hi there!
Perl separates statements by semicolons.
This string
shows up on two lines.
This string \n shows up on only one.
This variable is 5.
This list contains 3 variables: One, Two, and Three.
Call hash (dictionary) elements as with other variables.
Here's One:1
To see the keys in a hash, do:
Three One Two 
i is currently: 1
i is currently: 2
i is currently: 3
i is currently: 4
i is currently: 5
Three is 3 in this hash.
One is 1 in this hash.
Two is 2 in this hash.
